A little map dev/mod dev utility to help people working with nbt items and tiles.

Item NBT
To see an Item NBT tag just activate the advanced tooltips by pressing F3+H, the tag will appear inside the tooltip. Longer tags will be presented in an auto scrolling view, the scroll speed can be controlled with SHIFT, to pause scrolling, and ALT, to speed it up. The default scrolling speed and the maximum number of tag lines shown at once can be configured.
